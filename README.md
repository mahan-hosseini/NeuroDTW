# NeuroDTW - DTW Analyses for Neuroscientific Time Series Data

If you are a reviewer or editor and would like to see our code and data please send me an email at m.hosseini@fz-juelich.de, I would be happy to share. There is already documentation in the matlab folders if you'd like to explore that.

This repository will include MATLAB code to reproduce the findings of the paper _Transient Attention Gates Access Consciousness: Coupling N2pc and P3 Latencies using Dynamic Time Warping_ as well as general-purpose MATLAB functions and a Python module that enable dtw based analyses for any two time series obtained in neuroscience.

Please see the matlab & python folders for respective documentations, example data files, walkthrough tutorials.

Please see individual code files for a more thorough explanation on conceptual approaches and input parameters.
