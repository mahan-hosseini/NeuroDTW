# NeuroDTW - DTW Analyses for Neuroscientific Time Series Data

**NeuroDTW** is a MATLAB and Python toolbox for **Dynamic Time Warping based latency differences & temporal correlations** between two time series of any kind. The exact methodology has been introduced in *Hosseini et al. - Transient Attention Gates Access Consciousness: Coupling N2pc and P3 Latencies using Dynamic Time Warping (2024)* in the context of event-related potentials (ERPs). This repository further provides the MATLAB scripts & data files used to generate the findings of this paper.  

Please see the **matlab & python folders** for respective documentations, example data files, walkthrough tutorials and individual code files with the latter including a more thorough explanation on conceptual approaches and input parameters.
