# NeuroDTW - DTW Analyses for neuroscientific Time Series Data

This repository will include MATLAB code to reproduce the findings of the paper _Transient Attention Gates Access Consciousness: Coupling N2pc and P3 Latencies using Dynamic Time Warping_ as well as general-purpose MATLAB functions and a Python module that enable dtw based analyses for any two time series obtained in neuroscience.
