# NeuroDTW - DTW Analyses for Neuroscientific Time Series Data

NeuroDTW is a MATLAB and Python toolbox for Dynamic Time Warping based analyses of latency differences as well as temporal correlations between two time series of any kind. The exact methodology has been introduced in the paper _Transient Attention Gates Access Consciousness: Coupling N2pc and P3 Latencies using Dynamic Time Warping_ in the context of event-related potentials (ERPs). This repository further provides the MATLAB code used to generate the findings of this paper.  

Please see the matlab & python folders for respective documentations, example data files, walkthrough tutorials and individual code files for a more thorough explanation on conceptual approaches and input parameters.
